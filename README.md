The prices listed in this BOM reflect the costs at the time of purchase and may no longer be accurate. This BOM is provided for reference only and should not be considered a precise cost estimate.

## üî® Assembly Instructions

Assembly instructions are available [here]().

## 3D Printing Profile

Print profiles and STL files for the robot parts are [hosted on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/).

Make sure to follow the recommended print settings for optimal strength and fitment.

## üìù Notes

1. The `MG996.stl` is used in the URDF, we won't need it to build the actual robot. Check out the [simulation repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Simulation).

2. I just found this [amazing web-based urdf visualizer](https://gkjohnson.github.io/urdf-loaders/javascript/example/bundle/). You can just drag and drop a urdf file and the `CAD` folder and it will display the robot. This was quite handy during development.  

## TODO

- [ ] Update the assembly instructions PDF.
- [ ] Update the MakerWorld link with the correct URL.
