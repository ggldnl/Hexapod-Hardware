# Hexapod Hardware

This repository contains the 3D-printed parts, BOM and assembly guide to replicate my hexapod robot. 

For a complete overview of the project, refer to the [main Hexapod repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod). Additionally, you may want to check out the repositories containing the [Controller](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Controller) and [Operator](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Operator) code.

## 📋 Bill of Materials (BOM)

Below is a summary of the components required to build the hexapod:

## 🔨 Assembly Instructions

To be provided in a detailed PDF. [: Link to the assembly instructions PDF]

## 3D Printing Profile

Print profiles and STL files for the robot parts are [hosted on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/).

Make sure to follow the recommended print settings for optimal strength and fitment.

## 📝 Notes

The `MG996.stl` is there only for simulation purposes (it is used to build the URDF), we won't need it to build the robot. Check out the [simulation repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Simulation).

## TODO

- [ ] Update the assembly instructions PDF.
- [ ] Update the MakerWorld link with the correct URL.
- [ ] Verify and finalize the BOM.
